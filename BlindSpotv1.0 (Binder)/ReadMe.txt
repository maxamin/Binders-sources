This project was written to get myself oriented in GUI programming with
the Win32 API. It can bind an unlimited number of files with a small
stub, smaller than most other stubs for binders coded in VB or Delphi.

IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE THIS SOURCE CODE, PLEASE GIVE CREDIT WHERE IT
IS DUE.

The stub included in the resources of the binder may not take too well
to packing. However size should not be an issue here, but if you are so
keen on packing it just ask me and I will tell you how to go about it.

This should be undetected by most big box AVs at the time of release,
but some scanners that rely heavily on heuristics might be able to pick
it up. I do NOT recommend scanning it online, unless of course you want
it to get detected. If you want it undetected to all AVs consider the
purchase of an undetected copy for a small cost.
